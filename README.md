## 🚀 Description

This repository consists of my work for the Frontend Applications course, which is part of the [Information Design - Tech Track](https://github.com/cmda-tt) given in the 3rd year of the study Communication and Multimedia design at the Hogeschool van Amsterdam.

The goal of this course is to learn how to work with front-end frameworks such as ReactJS
